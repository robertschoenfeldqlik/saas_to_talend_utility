# SaaS to Talend — single-image multi-stage Dockerfile
#
# Runs all three services inside one container:
#   • Java Spring Boot engine (port 8081)          — Talend XML generator
#   • Node.js Express server  (port 3000)          — API proxy + SQLite store
#   • React SPA (served by Express from /client/dist)
#
# Exposed port: 3000. That's the only port a user needs to hit.
# Node Express serves the React build on / and proxies /api/engine/* to the
# Java JVM running side-by-side inside the same container.
#
# Build:  docker build -t saas-to-talend .
# Run:    docker run -p 3000:3000 saas-to-talend
#         then open http://localhost:3000

# ─── STAGE 1: build the Java engine ────────────────────────────────────────
FROM maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS engine-build

# Pre-fetch deps to leverage layer cache when only source changes
RUN mvn -B -q dependency:go-offline

RUN npm ci --omit=dev --no-audit --no-fund

# ─── FINAL STAGE: runtime image ────────────────────────────────────────────
# Use the official node:22-alpine base (pins Node to the 22.x LTS line) and
# add OpenJDK 17 JRE on top. Earlier versions of this Dockerfile based on
# eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine + `apk add nodejs` silently drifted to
# whatever node version Alpine shipped (we observed v24 in production
# while the build stages were pinned to 20). Inverting the base — Node
# primary, JRE addon — gives us a single explicit pin for both runtimes.
FROM node:22-alpine

# Add the JRE for the Java engine and tini for proper PID 1 init. We also
# remove the globally-installed npm: at runtime we only run `node` and
# `java`, never `npm`, so leaving the bundled npm around just keeps its
# transitive deps (e.g. picomatch) showing up in CVE scans for no reason.
# Server + client modules are already installed in their respective build
# stages and copied over below.
# chromium (+ its runtime libs/fonts) backs the optional headless renderer used
# for JS-rendered API-doc pages; puppeteer-core drives this system binary rather
# than downloading its own. If you don't need headless rendering you can drop
# the chromium packages to shrink the image by ~250 MB.

# Hand ownership to the unprivileged 'node' user (uid 1000, pre-created by
# node:alpine) and switch to it. The runtime never needs root after this —
# both the Java engine and Express only listen on ports >1024 and write
# only under /opt/app/server/data. Captured probe fixtures will be created
# by uid 1000, so the named volume inherits those permissions on first
# `docker run`. If you mount a host directory for the volume, that host
# path must be writable by uid 1000 (or pass --user $(id -u):$(id -g)).
